# The disputed areas Cat Atlas draws with stripes, from Natural Earth's 1:50m breakaway and disputed areas.
# The rule (the owner's): stripe land where the map, drawn the UN's way, and whoever actually runs it disagree; or a
# region split by a ceasefire line where the UN takes no view on which side is whose. So the Koreas aren't striped
# (the UN has both as member states, each with its own side). Palestine isn't striped either: Israel runs much of the
# West Bank, but this map data can't show which parts, and striping all of it would mark land Palestinians do run.
# Natural Earth's other disputed areas are drawn plainly, as the country that runs them. Every dispute, striped or not,
# belongs in the disputed-territory round.
# Western Sahara is striped whole (Natural Earth's shape is only the Moroccan-held part), so its outline comes from
# the game's map.
