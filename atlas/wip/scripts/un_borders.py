# Redraw disputed land the way the UN sees it, for Cat Atlas.
# World Map Recall's world.json (Natural Earth 1:50m) draws some land as the side that controls it. Using Natural
# Earth's 1:50m breakaway and disputed areas, this moves:
#   Crimea from Russia to Ukraine, the Golan Heights from Israel to Syria, and the Moroccan-held part of
#   Western Sahara from Morocco to Western Sahara.
# The Chagos Islands stay a shape of their own (they're quizzed as "Chagos Islands (Mauritius)"); the game names
# Mauritius as their country, as the UN General Assembly voted in 2019.
# It also splits off overseas places that have their own ISO country code but are drawn inside their country's
# shape (French Guiana, Réunion, Svalbard…), so they can be quizzed on their own and don't light up with it.
# Places without a code of their own (Alaska, Hawaii, the Canaries, the Azores, Madeira) stay with their country.
# Run: python3 un_borders.py <world.json> <ne_50m_admin_0_breakaway_disputed_areas.geojson> <out.json>
