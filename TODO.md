# To do

Things to come back to, kept here so any chat can pick them up. Add an item when something is put aside; take it out
(in the same PR) once it's done. Game ideas go in `IDEAS.md`, and work on Apple's guidelines in `HIG.md` ("Still to do").

## Catlas: Safari still offers AutoFill Contact in the answer box

On an iPhone, typing an answer in Catlas (Type answers) brings up Safari's AutoFill Contact bar above the keyboard,
offering the player's contacts. Safari ignores `autocomplete="off"` when it decides a box belongs to a contact or
address form.

Tried (still shows, checked on the owner's iPhone after rhymes-with-tree/catdoku#216, 2026-11-02):
- `autocomplete="off"` on the box and on its form
- the placeholder changed from "Type the name" to "Your guess", and the box's name from `answer` to `guess`
- `type="search"` in place of `type="text"`

Still to try:
- take the box out of its `<form>` (handle Enter and the Go button in script); Safari looks for contact fields in forms
- `autocomplete` set to something Safari doesn't recognise (such as `autocomplete="nope"`) rather than `off`
- make the box read-only until it's tapped, then drop `readonly` on focus
- if none of that works, a `contenteditable` box styled like the input
Test each on a real iPhone: Safari's AutoFill doesn't show in the headless browser the tests use.

## Shelves: split Kitten Play once its action games arrive

Talked through with the owner on 2026-11-02, the reasoning kept so it can be weighed again. That day Toy Box, Night
Light and Pawlette moved to Curious Cat, Cat Pile to Kitten Play, and Catlas to Kitten Play, retiring Cat Travels.
Shelves live in `GROUPS` in `games.js` (with their colours in `SHELF_COLOUR`, short names in `SHORT` in `index.html`,
and colours again in `calendar/index.html`), and a game's shelf is the fifth field of its row in `GAMES`.

**The test for Curious Cat and Kitten Play.** Curious Cat ("Moves to plan and shapes to fit") gives you a fixed board
to plan your way through, and nothing new turns up while you think. Kitten Play ("Match, pop, spot and chase") keeps
bringing new things (falling toys, the next bubble, birds, the snake moving), so chance and timing count as much as
planning, and you play for a score or a level's goal rather than solving one set position; its looking games
(Copycat, Cat Burglar, Catlas) are quick rounds of spotting and finding. Cat Trails ("Join, link and route things")
holds together: every game there is drawing or routing lines. Yarn, Catwalk and Tunnel Run are logic puzzles with one
answer, but drawing lines puts them on Trails, and that's on purpose. Borderline on Curious Cat but staying: Pick of
the Pile (partly spotting pairs, still a fixed board to clear in a good order) and Shelf Life (judged by eye more than
planned).

**Don't add shelves yet.** A phone shows three tiles across, and every shelf adds a label tile and starts a new row,
so a shelf of two to four games costs a lot of screen for little. Counts on 2026-11-02, games on the site / shortlist
ideas: Cat Logic 9/3, Cat Math 6/0, Cat Trails 6/1, Cat Spells 8/5, Curious Cat 10/5, Kitten Play 10/3.

**Split Kitten Play once its action games arrive.** It's more than one kind of game sharing a shelf. Its ideas fall in
two groups:
- match and pop: Onet-style pairs, SameGame groups, a triple-tile tray; with Pounce, Bubbles, Wind Up, Mew Hue and
  Cat Pile
- action: Pawlinko (was Kitty Plinko), Paw-ball, Pounce Up, a fling game, kneading in time with the purr; with Tail Chase and Bird
  Watch, and the looking games (Copycat, Cat Burglar, Catlas) could go with them
The action group is two to five games today, too few for a shelf. Once a couple of the shortlisted ones (Pawlinko,
Paw-ball, Pounce Up) are built, split it.

**Cat Spells stays one shelf.** With its five shortlisted ideas it would have 13 games, but there's no natural split:
finding words and moving letters to make words are the same kind of game (the owner's call). Cat Math has no ideas
waiting, but six games is a fine shelf; leave it.

**Colour games, if Curious Cat gets crowded.** Cat Mat (flood fill), Shelf Life (colour gradient), Pawlette (mix
paint to order), all on Curious Cat, and Mew Hue (slide and mix paint) on Kitten Play are colour games. With its five
shortlisted ideas built, Curious Cat would be the biggest shelf at 15. If that's too many, split the colour games off
into a shelf of their own: a colour shelf of 4, leaving Curious Cat with 12. Not decided; weigh it once the shortlist
is mostly built.

With the shortlist built and both splits, the shelves would be (66 games): Cat Logic 12, Cat Math 6, Cat Trails 7,
Cat Spells 13, Curious Cat 12, colour 4, Kitten Play (match and pop) 5, action 8. Without the colour split, Curious Cat
15 and no colour shelf.

## Pawlinko: sound effects

The owner wants sound effects for Pawlinko, put aside for later (2026-11-02): a knock as each thing hits a hold,
a boing off a coil spring, a splash when coffee or water spills, a soft thump as it lands in a bed (and a sleepy
grumble from a napping cat), and a cheer for a tandem. No game on the site has sound yet, so this needs a shared way to
play it first: a Sound switch in the settings (off by default, as browsers only play sound after a tap), quiet enough
for a phone, and sounds that follow the thing's kind (a bell rings, a mug clunks, a feather makes none).
